<h3 align="center">Big data analytics, with experience in data analysis in the construction industry.
I live in Turkey at the moment.</h3>

This is my repository with projects completed as part of the "Data Analyst" course from Yandex.Workshop. At the moment I am looking for a project or job Big Data Analyst in any field, remotely or with the possibility of relocation.

- Experience as a data analyst
- Graduated from Yandex.workshop courses
- As a hobby, I ended my small game project "Nuubs"

Separately, I want to highlight the project and presentation that seemed to me the most interesting:

[Sales funnel analysis and evaluation of A/A/B testing results](https://github.com/aegorovspb/yandex_data_analyst_projects_eng/blob/main/08_aab_test_app.ipynb)

[Presentation "SALE FUNNEL"](https://github.com/aegorovspb/yandex_data_analyst_projects_eng/tree/main/08_aab_test_presentation)
