### Big data analytics, with experience in data analysis in the construction industry.

This is my repository with projects completed as part of the "Data Analyst" course from Yandex.Workshop. At the moment I am looking for a project or job Big Data Analyst in any field, remotely or with the possibility of relocation.

- Experience as a data analyst
- Graduated from Yandex.workshop courses
- As a hobby, I ended my small game project "Nuubs"
